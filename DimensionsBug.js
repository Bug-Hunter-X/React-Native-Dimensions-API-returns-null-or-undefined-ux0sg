This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions. The `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` functions return an object with `width` and `height` properties.  However, if you use them before the component mounts fully, they may return null or undefined, leading to errors like `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Dimensions.get('window').width')`.
