This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications when using the Dimensions API to obtain screen dimensions.  The issue arises when attempting to access the width and height properties of the Dimensions object before the component has fully mounted. This results in undefined values being returned, leading to runtime errors. The provided solution uses useEffect to ensure the Dimensions API is accessed after the component mounts.
